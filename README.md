# PhysiCell-ECM: A PhysiCell extension to account for the extracellular matrix

> This extension was developed for PhysiCell 1.7.1 (most recent at the time of publication)

## Overview:
This extension aims to implement the effect of the mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) into the PhysiCell framework [1]. To do so, we have extended the PhysiCell code to take into account the viscosity of the ECM on individual cell migration.

We have used previously published experimental data [2], obtained for collagen matrices of different collagen densities, to characterize the effect of matrix density on both single cell motility and its subsequent effect

The mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix for the collagen matrices used experimentally have also been characterized previously [3].
